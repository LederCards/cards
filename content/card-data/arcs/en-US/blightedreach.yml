    *The Founder of the Commonwealth can add the Commonwealth Ambition marker to an ambition they declare.*
     
    **Score this ambition as follows:**
     
    This ambition only gives Power for winning it—getting first place with no tie.
     
    All Members of the **Commonwealth** combine ambition values into the Commonwealth to determine place for gaining Power. *(Use individual ambition values for everything else, like objectives.)*
     
    If the Commonwealth wins, evenly divide the total Power of first and second place among Members. Ignore bonus city Power and Power remainders.
     
    If a non-Member wins, they gain ***double*** the total Power of first and second place.

    For each resource type, a player takes the Monopoly card of its type if they have more than half of the total resources of its type in play.
     
    *Usually this means you need 3 resources out of 5. Some Fates add resources or scrap them, removing them from play. Two-player games remove resources from play onto ambition boxes.*

    Faithful cards are a new suit of action cards. When you **secure** one from the Court, draw it into your hand.
     
    When you play one, place the card on either its ***Zeal*** or ***Wisdom*** side.
     
    Zeal lets you move, influence, battle, or tax
     
    Wisdom lets you build, repair, or secure
     
    **They have a couple differences from normal action cards:**
     
    To **Surpass** a Faithful card, you must play a Faithful card on the same side. *(So if a player leads Zeal, you only Surpass if you play Zeal. You can still Pivot to Wisdom.)*
     
    You do not seize the initiative when you **Surpass** with a "7" Faithful action card.

    **Follow these same rules from before:**
     
    You must play Faithful action cards on the same side as the **Doctrine.**
     
    When you play a Faithful action card, you must follow these rules on your turn when you want to **declare an ambition.**
     
    *If the ambition box **has no Ideal** marker, place an Ideal marker showing the Doctrine in the box.*
     
    *If the ambition box **does have an Ideal marker,** you cannot declare this ambition if its Ideal doesn't match the Doctrine.*
     
    **There is one new limit:** When you play a non-Faithful card, you cannot declare an ambition with an Ideal this turn.

    **Prelude:** If your Flagship is at a planet with no Clue token, you may spend 1 resource that is different from all planets in its cluster to make the player to your right place 1 Clue token at the planet. Gain 1 resource of the planet type for each city there, and place 2 ships there for each starport there.
     
    A "Check" Clue means the planet is ***either*** in the right cluster or it has the correct ID symbol (`symbol:arrow`/`symbol:hex`/`symbol:moon`).
     
    An "X" Clue means the planet is ***not*** in the right cluster and does ***not*** have the correct ID symbol (`symbol:arrow`/`symbol:hex`/`symbol:moon`).

    The Pathfinder can make you place a Clue token at a planet. If you have none in your supply, take it from the map.
     
    Place the Clue on its "Check" side if the planet is either in the correct cluster or has the correct ID symbol (`symbol:arrow`/`symbol:hex`/`symbol:moon`).

    ***Balance the Reach***
     
    At the end of a chapter, **advance `symbol:clock`1** for each ambition where any players are tied for first place.
     
    *If you're playing with 2 players, the resources on ambitions can cause a player to tie.*
     
    *If a Commonwealth ambition is declared, it only advances the Judge if individual players tie for first place. Do not combine ambition values for this.*
     
    **At the end of a chapter, you win the game if you completed your objective and have at least 1 Power.**

    **If you're a Rival of the Judge, follow these rules:**
     
    You may take actions with the Judge's Loyal ships. *(Their ships don't add to your control.)*
     
    When attacking anyone except the Judge in **battle**, you may add the Judge's Loyal ships in the battle system to your attacking ships.
     
    When attacking the Judge in **battle**, Judge's Loyal ships add to their defending pieces, not your attacking ships.

    The Judge may declare ***any*** ambition, placing ***any*** unplaced ambition marker. *(It doesn't need to have the most Power.)* If they do, they lose Power for second place on the declared ambition marker.
     
    Then, return the Judge's Chosen card to the Judge. The Judge must give it to any Rival.

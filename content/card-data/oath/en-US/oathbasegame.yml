    your site whose suit does not match any of your advisers. _(You can recover
    it from yourself or the shared bank freely.)_ The new holder must place more
    `symbol:secret` than old `symbol:secret` here, then takes one
    `symbol:secret` from the old `symbol:secret` here, and the old holder takes
    the rest. **Search**: Spend 2 Supply if you're drawing from the world deck
    _(not the printed cost)_.

    If they Discard a matching card, the Duchy loses one victory point.

    If they cannot, the Duchy sways a minister, as in the Sway action, but the minister must also match a clearing of removal.

    When playing with the Corvid human or bot against any bots, use these rules for bombs and snares:

    **Bomb**: When flipped, removed two pieces of each bot in its clearing, warriors first, instead of all their pieces.

    **Snare**: Bots ignore snare tokens for the purpose of targeting clearing to place or move pieces.

    If a bot would place in a clearing with a snare of move out of a clearing with a snare, remove the snare but do not preform this part of the action.

    (*The Vagabot will continue to move after this happens, exhausting extra items.)

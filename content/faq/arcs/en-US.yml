        If I secure $link:Farseers$, does *Connected* trigger?
      a: >-
        No. $link:Farseers$ being drawn as a result of Connected does not see the timing window to then trigger its ability to look at a Rival's hand and swap a card with them.

        Each turn, you can only tax or build a ship with *Ruthless*, not both.
    - q: >-
        If a city is destroyed with *Ruthless*, when do I provoke Outrage?

        $link:Predictive Sensors$ is subject to this restriction. When the Rebel uses $link:Predictive Sensors$, they can move in up to 2 ships from each adjacent system. This is because a move is defined as “number of Loyal ships from one system to an adjacent system.”

        If you are the $link:Upstart$, have $link:Empath's Bond$, and Empath is declared, can you tax a loyal city that you do not control?
      a: >-
        The "any" in $link:Empath's Bond$ should be interpreted as "non-Loyal," and Callow should be rephrased to “You cannot tax cities that you do not control.” As a result, $link:Empath's Bond$ when active only gives the Upstart the ability to use Rival starports to build and Catapult move.
  card: Upstart

    - q: >-
        Can I spend a resource to build a city while outraged in that resource?
      a: >-
        Yes, Outrage does not stop you from spending the resource at all. It only stops you from spending it for its standard Prelude action.
    - q: >-
        Do I need to have the resource to build the city?
      a: >-
        Building a Cloud City requires spending a resource of the planet type.
    - q: >-

        Is *Fire Rifles* modified by abilities that modify Battle?

    - q: >-
        How does this interact with the Imperial Truce Law?
      a: >-
        It causes harm in the target system, so you cannot target a Regent in a system with Imperial ships, but you can use Galactic Rifles from a system with Imperial ships.

    - q: >-
        What happens if the cluster has no cities?
      a: >-
        If a Gate Station is in a cluster with no other city, it has no type. Destroying it provokes no Outrage. Taxing it yields no resource, but it can still be taxed.
    - q: >-
        What happens if this is transferred with $link:Knowledge Set Free$ or scrapped from the $link:Caretaker Act III Objective$?
      a: >-
        If transferred, your cities in gates still operate in the same way. If scrapped, your cities in gates no longer have a type, so they no longer produce resources when taxed and no longer Provoke Outrage when destroyed.
    - q: >-
        If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a city in the same gate?

  card: Raider Exosuits
- faq:
    - q: >-
        Can you limit which ships are battling?
      a: >-
        Attacker's Loyal ships in the battle system are all “attacking ships”. Therefore, all Loyal ships in the battle system must be fresh at the start of battle to use Signal Breaker.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break block the Intercept generated by $link:Mirror Plating$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker lets you “ignore one intercept you roll”. However, this cannot ignore the intercept added by Mirror Plating, because it is not rolled.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break take effect before $link:Railgun Arrays$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker checks if all the attacking ships are fresh at the beginning of the battle, before Railgun Arrays deals one hit.

        Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?

    - q: >-
        Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?
      a: >-
        You can Catapult move with the bonus move.
    - q: >-
        If I catapult move and drop off ships in gates along my path, can each ship move again?
      a: >-
        Each fresh Loyal ship that moved can move one more time, independently and to a different destination.
    - q: >-
        Can I move Imperial ships with the second move?

        How does this interact with $link:Material Cartel$ or $link:Fuel Cartel$?
      a: >-

        Yes, as you still declared an ambition, even though you placed something different.
    - q: >-
        What happens if a Commonwealth ambition marker is in an ambition box without another ambition marker, such as if a crisis undeclared it?

        If a Rival of the Caretaker spends a Golem and no one has resource slots on their player boards, do they keep the Golem or put it on Golem Hearth?

    - q: >-
        How does this interact with cards like $link:Well of Empathy$ that give unlimited resource slots?

        How does this card interact with $link:Relic Cartel$?

        When exactly does someone keep a Golem after using it?
      a: >-
        If the player with the $link:Golem Hearth$ uses a Golem and nobody else has slots. As long as the Golem Hearth is in the game, its holder will always have slots for Golems.

        Nope!
    - q: >-
        Are Golems resources? 
      a: >-
        Nope! The text 'can be spent for actions like resources' just means that you spend them in your Prelude to take their listed actions like you do with resources. You can't spend them to take New Actions or, for example, or as inputs for Loyal cards like $link:Loyal Engineers$.

    - q: >-
        When I declare an ambition to place a conspiracy, does this still count as declaring an ambition for cards like $link:Farseers$, $link:Parade Fleets$, $link:Doctrinal Faith$, and so on?

        What happens when a Regent with Rogue Admirals attacks another Regent?
      a: >-
        The attacker can add any number of Imperial ships in the system to their attacking ships. Remaining Imperial ships are defending ships. (This is modeling the Empire breaking up into rival admiralties who each have a claim on the Empire's military, who's loyal, and who's a traitor.)

        If I secure $link:Farseers$, does *Connected* trigger?

    - q: >-
        If a city is destroyed with *Ruthless*, when do I provoke Outrage?

        $link:Predictive Sensors$ is subject to this restriction. When the Rebel uses $link:Predictive Sensors$, they can move in up to 2 ships from each adjacent system. This is because a move is defined as “number of Loyal ships from one system to an adjacent system.”

        The "any" in $link:Empath's Bond$ should be interpreted as "non-Loyal," and Callow should be rephrased to “You cannot tax cities that you do not control.” As a result, $link:Empath's Bond$ when active only gives the Upstart the ability to use Rival starports to build and Catapult move.

        Can I spend a resource to build a city while outraged in that resource?

        What happens if the cluster has no cities?
      a: >-
        If a Gate Station is in a cluster with no other city, it has no type. Destroying it provokes no Outrage. Taxing it yields no resource, but it can still be taxed.

        What happens if this is transferred with $link:Knowledge Set Free$ or scrapped from the $link:Caretaker Act III Objective$?
      a: >-
        If transferred, your cities in gates still operate in the same way. If scrapped, your cities in gates no longer have a type, so they no longer produce resources when taxed and no longer Provoke Outrage when destroyed.

    - q: >-
        Can you limit which ships are battling?
      a: >-
        Attacker's Loyal ships in the battle system are all “attacking ships”. Therefore, all Loyal ships in the battle system must be fresh at the start of battle to use Signal Breaker.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break block the Intercept generated by $link:Mirror Plating$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker lets you “ignore one intercept you roll”. However, this cannot ignore the intercept added by Mirror Plating, because it is not rolled.
    - q: >-
        Does Signal Break take effect before $link:Railgun Arrays$?
      a: >-
        Signal Breaker checks if all the attacking ships are fresh at the beginning of the battle, before Railgun Arrays deals one hit.

        Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?

        No, it is not recursive. The more verbose but correct text is: When you move fresh Loyal ships but not with Sprinter Drives, you may move any of them one more time.
    - q: >-
        Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?
      a: >-
        You can Catapult move with the bonus move.
    - q: >-
        If I catapult move and drop off ships in gates along my path, can each ship move again?

    - q: >-
        When exactly does someone keep a Golem after using it?
      a: >-
        If the player with the $link:Golem Hearth$ uses a Golem and nobody else has slots. As long as the Golem Hearth is in the game, its holder will always have slots for Golems.

        Nope!
    - q: >-
        Are Golems resources? 
      a: >-
        Nope! The text 'can be spent for actions like resources' just means that you spend them in your Prelude to take their listed actions like you do with resources. You can't spend them to take New Actions or, for example, or as inputs for Loyal cards like $link:Loyal Engineers$.

        Yes! Refill is the last step of secure, after you've taken the card.
    - q: >-

    Operators:
      ID:
        Name: ID
        Text: >
          You can find cards that match a certain id (partially or exactly) by using the `id:` operator.


          This operator is special, you may also search without using the operator.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`OATH-001`'
            Text: Find specifically the card matching the id OATH-001.

          - Example: '`id:=OATH-001`'
            Text: Find specifically the card matching the id OATH-001.

          - Example: '`-id:OATH`'
            Text: Exclude all cards with the id OATH.

      Name:
        Name: Name
        Text: >
          You can find cards that have a certain name by using the `name:` or `n:` operator.


          This operator is a loose-text operator, which means that you can use partial names. You can also specify multiple expansions by separating them with a comma. If a name has spaces in its name, you must use quotation marks around the name.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`Alchemist`'
            Text: Cards with "alchemist" in their name.

          - Example: '`name:alchemist`'
            Text: Cards with "alchemist" in their name.

          - Example: '`name:"=Alchemist"`'
            Text: Cards that are called exactly "Alchemist".

          - Example: '`-name:"Alchemist"`'
            Text: Cards without "alchemist" in their name.

      CardText:
        Name: Card Text
        Text: >
          You can find cards that match a certain expansion by using the `cardtext:` or `t:` operator.

          This operator is a loose-text operator, which means that you can search any part of the card text.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`cardtext:secure`'
            Text: Cards with "secure" in their text.

          - Example: '`-t:"secure"`'
            Text: Cards without "secure" in their text.

      Errata:
        Name: Errata
        Text: >
          You can find cards that have errata entries with the `errata:` or `e:` operator.

          This operator is a numeric operator, meaning you'll by default want to search for `errata:>0` to find entries with any errata entries.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`errata:>0`'
            Text: Cards that have any number of errata entries.

          - Example: '`errata:=0`'
            Text: Cards with no errata entries.

      FAQ:
        Name: FAQ
        Text: >
          You can find cards that have FAQ entries with the `faq:` or `f:` operator.

          This operator is a numeric operator, meaning you'll by default want to search for `faq:>0` to find entries with any FAQs.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`faq:>0`'
            Text: Cards that have any number of FAQ entries.

          - Example: '`faq:=0`'
            Text: Cards with no FAQ entries.

      Game:
        Name: Game
        Text: >
          You can find cards that are associated with a certain game by using the `game:` operator.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`game:oath`'
            Text: Cards that belong to the Oath game.

          - Example: '`-game:root`'
            Text: Cards that don't belong to the Root game.

      Product:
        Name: Product
        Text: >
          You can find cards that are associated with a certain product by using the `product:` operator.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`product:clockwork-1`'
            Text: Cards that belong to the Clockwork 1 product.

          - Example: '`-product:exiles-partisans`'
            Text: Cards that don't belong to the Exiles & Partisans product.

      Tag:
        Name: Tag
        Text: >
          You can find cards that have a certain tag by using the `tag:` search operator. Almost every card will have a tag. You can find a list of valid tags by using the advanced search page.

        Examples:
          - Example: '`tag:"Power"`'
            Text: Cards that have the Power tag.

          - Example: '`tag:"Power,Arcane"`'
            Text: Cards that have the Power and Arcane tags.

          - Example: '`tag:none`'
            Text: Cards with no tags.
